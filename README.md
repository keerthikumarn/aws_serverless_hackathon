# AWS Severless Hackathon

This PoC is submitted as part of the AWS serverless hackathon.

## Current Challenge
1. The resume can give what he has worked on so far but it fails to reveal what he/she wants to do in the future job.
2. The employer has to call the candidate up to know these information which further takes more time.
3. Today candidateâ€™s resumes contain on an average 4 to 8 pages of information which may or may not read by the employer.  
The candidate cannot showcase:
    - Communication skills
    - Body language
    - Confidence
    - What he/she wants from the future job

## How can we help
- To ease this process candidate will upload 1 to 2 min of introductory video about himself/herself. 
- This will help the employer whether to shortlist a candidate without calling him/her up
- This will not only save the time and also saves the chances of a candidate to get selected
